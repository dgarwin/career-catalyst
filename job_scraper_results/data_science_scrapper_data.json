This role will coordinate with our hardware team to improve data collection from our novel spectral soil probe for building machine learning models, will partner with our soil science team to collect and analyze soil and geospatial data sets, and will collaborate with our business development team to accurately and effectively communicate soil carbon results to our customers.On a typical day, our field team is out collecting data on farms. Raw data from spectrometers and other sensors get uploaded (once internet is available) and ingested by our data pipeline. Your job is to take this real-world messy data, process and normalize it, deal with partial collections and find inconsistencies. You\u2019ll collaborate across the company to combine that data with lab analyses and other data sources to build statistical and machine learning models that estimate carbon stocks. Your work drives the incentives for climate-friendly agriculture.Yard Stick is a remote-first company and the technology team is distributed around the U.S. This role will report directly to Yard Stick\u2019s VP of Software, and will work under the technical leadership of the Head of Data Science. This is a dream job for someone who loves working with data, is curious about soil science, and wants to join a growing startup with literal planetary-scale impact.We\u2019d like to hire this person to start ASAP.About Yard Stick PBCYard Stick is a remote-first climate tech startup with cofounders based in Boston, MA and Oakland, CA. We are on a mission to reverse climate change with agriculture. Scientists and farmers alike know that climate-friendly agricultural practices have the potential to remove atmospheric CO2 at gigaton/year scale. When these practices are adopted, more carbon is stored in soils, improving soil health and fighting climate change. But significant measurement challenges have held soil carbon efforts back - until now.By reducing the cost of soil carbon measurement by 70-90%, Yard Stick will dramatically expand the opportunities for evidence-based regenerative practices to simultaneously improve ecosystem health, increase farmer income, and combat climate change.\u00a0Current soil carbon measurement technologies are slow, expensive, and cumbersome, relying on conventional soil cores and labs to quantify carbon stocks. In contrast, Yard Stick is fast and cheap - without sacrificing accuracy. As a testament to our technology\u2019s potential, alongside our scientific collaborators, we were awarded $18M across six USDA Climate-Smart Commodities projects, and we have additional grant financing from ARPA-E, NSF, CDFA, and other discerning grant-makers. We\u2019ve also raised another nearly $18M from top climate VCs, including Toyota Climate Venture Fund, Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (Bill Gates\u2019 climate fund), Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, The Nature Conservancy, Extania, Pillar VC, MCJ Collective\u2026 the list goes on!For more background, check out some coverage of Yard Stick in TechCrunch, Fast Company, and AgFunder.We offer competitive salary and equity (benchmarked to 75th percentile of high-growth US tech compensation), health/dental/vision insurance, a 401k, and home-office reimbursements. We have many team members with young families and have a strong track record of creative, flexible approaches to hours and communication expectations which let folks feel great about their commitments both to Yard Stick and their lives outside of work.We\u2019re also a PBC, or public benefit corporation, which is an alternative corporate structure which protects our ability to prioritize climate impact over profits if the two are in conflict.

Please note that due to a high volume of very talented applicants, there may be a lag of several weeks between submission and follow-up from Apollo Research on your application. Thank you for your patience. About The Role: The capabilities of current AI systems are evolving at a rapid pace, providing us with great opportunities and challenges. The challenges could stem from either deliberate misuse or the deployment of sophisticated, yet misaligned AI models. At Apollo Research, we are especially concerned with deceptive alignment, i.e. where a model outwardly seems aligned but is in fact misaligned, and conceals this fact from human oversight.\u00a0The potential ramifications of deceptively aligned advanced AI could be catastrophic. Additionally, deceptive alignment causes other behavioral evaluations to yield inaccurate results since the model will attempt to fool the tests. Thus, our current objective is to develop evaluations specifically tailored for deceptive alignment.To evaluate models, we employ a variety of methods. Firstly, we intend to evaluate model behavior using basic prompting techniques and agentic scaffolding, similar to AutoGPT. Secondly, we aim to fine-tune models to study their generalization capabilities and elicit their dangerous potential within a safe, controlled environment (we have several security policies in place to mitigate potential risks). On a high level, our current approach to evaluating deceptive alignment consists of breaking down necessary capabilities and tracking how these scale with increasingly capable models. Some of these capabilities include situational awareness, stable non-myopic preferences, and particular kinds of generalization. In addition, we plan to build useful demos of precursor behaviors for further study.We\u2019re hiring Research Scientists, Research Engineers, and a Research Lead. Candidates are welcome to apply for multiple roles.\u00a0We welcome applicants of all races, genders, sexes, ages, abilities, religions, sexual orientations, regardless of pregnancy or maternity, marital status, or gender reassignment.Apollo Research\u00a0is a London-based technical AI safety organization. We specialize in auditing high-risk failure modes, particularly deceptive alignment, in large AI models. Our primary objective is to minimize catastrophic risks associated with advanced AI systems that may exhibit deceptive behavior, where misaligned models appear aligned in order to pursue their own objectives. Our approach involves conducting fundamental research on interpretability and behavioral model evaluations, which we then use to audit real-world models. Ultimately, our goal is to leverage interpretability tools for model evaluations, as we believe that examining model internals in combination with behavioral evaluations offers stronger safety assurances compared to behavioral evaluations alone.Culture: At Apollo, we aim for a culture that emphasizes truth-seeking, being goal-oriented, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and being friendly and helpful.
